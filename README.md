In this project, I used the image detection program OpenCV and Arduino to detect my face and automatically track and aim. Two servos were connected to the system, with face detection handled by the camera. The coordinates were sent to the Arduino via USB, which controlled the servos.

To complete this project, I used the Python libraries cv2 and pyserial (for USB communication).
